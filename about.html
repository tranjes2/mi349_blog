        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p><img src="jessica.jpg" alt="A photo of me!"></p>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jessica! I am a full-time student, and I also work part-time waitressing at a Korean Restaurant. 
            Aside from work and school, I have a variety of interests and hobbies such as drawing, knitting, 
            online shopping, reading, and cooking.</p>
        <p>I am also an avid watcher of TV, and often find myself lost in thoughts of the latest show I am watching. 
            While I would not say I am a television critic, or have any experience in analyzing media at all, I do have 
            strong opinions and thoughts about most of the shows and movies I watch. My favorite genre of television is 
            anime; I have a long list of animes that I have watched and plan to watch. These are some of my favorites:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attack on Titan</li>
            <li>Hunter x Hunter</li>
            <li>Food Wars</li>
            <li>Fruits Basket</li>
            <li>Jujutsu Kaisen</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All in all, I am your run-of-the-mill college student that waitresses on the side. This blog is a place for me to 
            write down my thoughts – mainly on media I watch – and share these opinions with my readers. In a way, it is 
            just a fun place for me to publish these ideas, so I am hoping you find the topics I write on interesting!</p>
